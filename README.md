# rg-labs

Laboratory exercises and personal project for the Computer Graphics course on FER.

### Lab 1

Load an .obj model and move and rotate it along a loaded spline

### Lab 2

Create a particle swarm (snowflakes)

## Project - Graphs and trees: search and shortest path algorithms

Trees - Visualise tree traversal with BFS and DFS, including a value search. The implementation supports any sort of graphs and trees with any number of neighbours, but for demonstration purposes and cleaner visuals the randomly generated trees are binary.

Graphs - Find and draw shortest path in graph between two nodes, searched through with an algorithm built on top off BFS with Dijkstra in mind, but without a priority queue. Supports only positive-weighted edges.

Abstract - Two things were implemented as part of this project: BFS and DFS which are visualised through randomly generated binary trees, and a shortest path algorithm similar and based off the knowledge BFS and Dijkstra visualised only as the final found path through a randomly generated graph.
